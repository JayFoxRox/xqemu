# This is a development repository

This is my personal development repository for the [XQEMU project (http://xqemu.com/)](http://xqemu.com).

XQEMU is an open source Xbox emulator based on [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)!

If you want to develop or try XQEMU yourself, you should stick to the [offical version](https://github.com/xqemu/xqemu).

# Purpose

This repository is used for planning work and sending Pull-Requests.

It also hosts [my personal priority list for XQEMU](https://github.com/JayFoxRox/xqemu/issues/8).

The branches on this repository are feature-branches.
If you need a combination of features you should merge that locally or wait until it's merged with the offical version.

There are also 2 similar legacy XQEMU repositories by me:

* [xqemu-jfr](https://github.com/JayFoxRox/xqemu-jfr): My short-lived, but impressive fork of XQEMU from 2014
* [xqemu-espes](https://github.com/JayFoxRox/xqemu-espes/): My development repository from 2014 to 2017 (when espes/xqemu was upstream)

# Donate

*Please keep in mind that XQEMU is a community effort.*
*[My work would be useless without others](https://github.com/xqemu/xqemu/graphs/contributors).*

If you like my personal contributions to the Xbox scene (tools, emulation, support, artwork, ...), a donation to me would be nice:
